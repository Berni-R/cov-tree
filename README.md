# Printing coverage in tree like structure

A simple library for reading the coverage reports from
[`coverage`](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/) and print them in a tree
structure (similar to the Linux tool
[`tree`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(command))).

A main functionality is to collapse sub-modules that have a certain minimal
coverage.

It can be used as a command line tool or as a Python package.
